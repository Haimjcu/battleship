Battleship Game.
First of all I want to say I am impressed with the level of understanding of the studied material.
Your javascript and styling shows that you know what you're doing!
To make your code shorter I would try styling with classes and css , or maybe instead of:
submarine.style.color="black"
submarine.style.backgroundColor="white";
submarine.style.borderColor="black";

I would do submarine.style="color:black;backgroundColor:white;borderColor:black;"

Also I might consider saving all the variables at the beggining of the code as an object and accessing the information through there.
It will cut your code length by a lot and improve readability.
Fantastic job Haim!
